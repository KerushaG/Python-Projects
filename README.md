# Python-Projects
 This is a collection of the projects that I found most interesting from the 1st level of my bootcamp. I was introduced to software   engineering by learning Python using Python's IDE. I learnt Python by creating programs to accommodate real-life scenarios and technical problem-solving. The 1st level covered the basics of pseudo code, variables, data types, converting, input/output, calculations, operators, control structures, basic data structures, reading/writing files, string manipulation, functions and error handling. I will also continue making adjustments and improvements on these projects, so I can further accommodate new discoveries.

## Basic Calculator
To consolidate what I learnt about control structures, operators, input and output, I made this program that offers the user basic calculation options to perform on two digits. 

## Courier Services
This program uses control structures to work out the total delivery costs of a user's package, dependent on their preferences for delivery.

## File Statistical Analysis
I applied what I learnt about reading and writing files, as well as lists, to read a file of numbers and perform calculations on them, writing the outcomes and old input to a new file. 

## Holiday Planner
This program calculates the costs of a rental car, accommodation and a flight for a user's holiday. It has a flight menu, that gives the user costs specific to their location and destination. 

## Investment Calculator
After asking the user for their investment deposit, type of interest and the rate and years of investment, the calculator outputs the expected return on the investment.

## Lottery Game
The user plays lottery against the programs randomly generated numbers, and based on the outcome they lose, or win different amounts of money based on accuracy of matching numbers.

## Sickle Cell Disease Detector
This program reads a DNA sequence and returns the SLC code by making use of a function.

## Tools I used
[Python & Idle](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - programming language and IDE
